# SPI Slave with Single Port RAM
* SPI is a synchronous serial communication protocol used to transfer data between a master and one or more slave devices. It operates in full-duplex mode, meaning that data can be sent and received simultaneously.
* Single-port RAM, on the other hand, allows only one operation (read or write) at a time, requiring careful management to avoid access conflicts.

* The goal of this project is to design and implement a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) slave device that interfaces with a synchronus single-port RAM.

## SPI Slave Module
The SPI slave module is responsible for receiving data from the master device and interacting with the RAM module. It has the following ports:

|    Name   | Type | Size | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---  |
| clk       |  Input | 1 bit  | Clock signal |
| rst_n     |  Input | 1 bit  | Active low reset signal |
| SS_n      |  Input | 1 bit  | Slave Select signal |
| MOSI      |  Input | 1 bit  | Master-Out-Slave-In data signal |
| tx_data   |  Input | 10 bit | Transfer data output signal, Takes MOSI for 10 clock cycles and stores it in tx_data to send it to the RAM |
| tx_valid  |  Input | 1 bit  | Indicates when tx_data is valid |
| MISO      | Output | 1 bit  | Master-In-Slave-Out data signal |
| rx_data   | Output | 10 bit | Received data from the memory |
| rx_valid  | Output | 1 bit  | Indicates when rx_data is valid |

## Single Port Async RAM Module
The single port asynchronous RAM module implements a memory block with a single data port.

* It has the following parameters:
  - MEM_DEPTH (default: 256): Depth of the memory.
  - ADDR_SIZE (default: 8): Size of the memory address.

* Ports:
  
|    Name   | Type | Size | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---  |
| clk       |  Input   | 1 bit   | Clock signal |
| rst_n     |  Input   | 1 bit   | Active low reset signal |
| din       |  Input   | 10 bit  | Data input |
| rx_valid  |  Input   | 1 bit   | If HIGH, accepts din[7:0] to save the write/read address internally or writes a memory word depending on the most significant 2 bits din[9:8] |
| dout      |  Output  | 8 bit   | Data output |
| tx_valid  |  Output  | 1 bit   | Whenever the command is a memory read, tx_valid should be HIGH |

* The most significant bits of din (din[9:8]) determine the operation to be performed:

|    Port   | din[9:8] | Command | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---  |
| din   | 00 | Write | Holds din[7:0] internally as a write address |
| din   | 01 | Write | Writes din[7:0] to the memory with the write address held previously |
| din   | 10 | Read  | Holds din[7:0] internally as a read address |
| din   | 11 | Read  | Reads the memory with the read address held previously. tx_valid should be HIGH, and dout holds the word read from the memory. din[7:0] is ignored |

### Wire connections:
* rx_data in the SPI slave module is connected to the din port in the RAM module.
* rx_valid in the SPI slave module is connected to rx_valid in the RAM module.
* dout in the RAM module is connected to tx_data in the SPI slave module.
* tx_valid in the RAM module is connected to tx_valid in the SPI slave module.

## Testbenches
The project includes the following testbenches:

+ SPI_tb.sv: SystemVerilog testbench for the SPI module.
+ RAM_tb.sv: SystemVerilog testbench for the RAM module.
+ SystemLevel_tb.sv: SystemVerilog testbench for the SystemLevel module.

These testbenches can be used to verify the functionality and performance of the SPI slave and single port RAM modules.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```ruby
git clone https://github.com/Abdelrahman1810/SPI_Slave_with_Single_Port_RAM.git
```
2. Open QuestaSim and navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned.
3. Compile the Verilog files by executing the following command in the QuestaSim transcript tap: 
```ruby
do run.do
```
This will compile the SPI.v, RAM.v, SystemLevel.v, tb_SPI.sv, tb_RAM.sv, tb_SystemLevel.sv, files and run the simulation with tb_SystemLevel.v file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to download [QuestaSim](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/) and [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html) first.

## Using Vivado
If you want to synthesize and implement the DSP48A1 design on an FPGA device using Vivado, follow these additional steps:

1. Launch Vivado and change directory to run.tcl file location.
```ruby
cd <RTL folder path>
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> path should have NO SPACES.

2. run the project by write this comand in TCL Console.
```ruby
source run.tcl
```
> [!NOTE]
> It will be better if you write a constrain file depending on the target FPGA.

> [!NOTE]
> constrain file written for specific FPGA "XC7A35TICPG236".
